All images have an associated json file with this basic information:

 * photo: the name/username of the photographer (on flickr)
 * source: The URL where I found the picture (a page on flickr)
 * license: A link to the license page. All images are licensed under some Creative Commons license.

I worked hard to make sure the information is correct, but I might have made errors, check the source to be sure.

If you want your own images in this game, just give it a name that has a suffix of '.jpg' or '.png', and a json file like the ones described above, and the game will automagically detect them. The 'license' in the json isn't required for the game to work because it's not used by the game, but you should fill in 'photo' and 'source' (you can fill it with nonsense). You can also deleta any images you don't like to remove them from the game.
